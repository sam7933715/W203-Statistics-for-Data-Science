Questions: 

1. What kind of details do we need?
- investigate what we don't have
- find the right methodologies
- in reality there are many more noises in the data
- most likely, likely, least likely to be important
- look at key relationship
- describe what's in there, even low correlation 
- don't make statements that aren't true
- describe the quality of the data
- describe what the visualizations tell us
 
2. What should we look for in the secondary effect?
- things that weren't included in the main analysis due to the set up of the question/analysis
- trying to see if we miss anything (variable)
- still relate to the primary factors but just discuss what we could have missed
- like season, location, etc

important to describe the potential problems of the data
not expected to model the data
just investigate relationship

2. Can we remove the 0 values?

For presentation, explain process, interesting findings/relationship

use log transformation to get to normal dist to be compared

- we can add 1 to the data set so that there won't be 0 area
- could be 2 cases: 1) area > 0, 2) area = 0
- in real world we should investigate what the 0's mean
- investigate with caution
- do two cases

-- inte pret ds
  


As shown in the graphs above:
1) Neither Square root transformation or logarithm transformation significantly improve any correlation strength

2) Area has noticeable positive correlation with X, Y, month, day, DMC, DC, and Temp, of which the correlations with DMC and Temp seem to be the strongest

3) Area and RH are negatively correlated

4) Area doesn't show much correlation with FFMC, ISI, Wind or Rain. Rain only has 8 non-zero data points so we shouldn't pay too much attention 

5) Month, DMC, DC, and Temp are positively related

6) FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, and Temp are positively related
